        <p class="centered"> Starting from the Wright Brothers, now to popular companies like Boeing and Airbus, 
            planes are the fastest and most complicated type of transportation. Planes starting from December 17, 1903 have come very far,

            <h2> The Wright Flyer </h2>
            <p> The first plane was created by the Wright Brothers. In 1903, the Wright Brothers
                created
                the Wright Flyer. The Wright Flyer has many nicknames, "Kitty Hawk", "Flyer I" or the "1903 Flyer."
                After the initial
                four flights the Wright Brothers did, the plane never flew again. In the days of the Wright Flyer, it
                was worth around
                $1,000 but today is found to be worth about $28,000. Unlike modern airplanes today that use kerosene,
                the Wright Flyer used
                normal gasoline. The wright flyer could carry 2 people, most likely a pilot and a co-pilot.

            <h2> The Me-262 Schwalbe </h2>
            <p>
                Powered by two Junkers Jumo 004 B turbine engines, and four 30-mm cannons, this jet could reach 540
                miles per hour.
                The Me-262 Schwalbe was the only jet seen in air-to-air combat in World War Two. There are only 9
                surviving jets,
                of this type left today. This jet costed 87,400 ℛℳ.

                <h2> The Boeing 707 </h2>
                <p>
                    Boeing's first commercial plane, the Boeing 707, with 219 seats and holding and a little over 90,000
                    liters of fuel, this plane could takeoff with 10,000 feet of runway. There are still 40 aircrafts of
                    this type
                    left in the world, mainly operated by the United States Air Force (USAF). 865 airrcrafts of this type
                    were
                    created, with 2 variants available; the Boeing 720 and the C-137 Stratoliner.
