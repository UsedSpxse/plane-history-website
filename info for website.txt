The first plane was created by the Wright Brothers. In 1903, the Wright Brothers
                created
                the Wright Flyer. The Wright Flyer has many nicknames, "Kitty Hawk", "Flyer I" or the "1903 Flyer."
                After the initial
                four flights the Wright Brothers did, the plane never flew again. In the days of the Wright Flyer, it
                was worth around
                $1,000 but today is found to be worth about $28,000. Unlike modern airplanes today that use kerosene,
                the Wright Flyer used
                normal gasoline. The wright flyer could carry 2 people, most likely a pilot and a co-pilot.

                Powered by two Junkers Jumo 004 B turbine engines, and four 30-mm cannons, this jet could reach 540
                miles per hour.
                The Me-262 Schwalbe was the only jet seen in air-to-air combat in World War Two. There are only 9
                surviving jets,
                of this type left today. This jet costed 87,400 ℛℳ.

                Boeing's first commercial plane, the Boeing 707, with 219 seats and holding and a little over 90,000
                liters of fuel, this plane could takeoff with 10,000 feet of runway. There are still 40 aircrafts of
                this type
                left in the world, mainly operated by the United States Air Force (USAF). 865 airrcrafts of this type
                were
                created, with 2 variants available; the Boeing 720 and the C-137 Stratoliner.
